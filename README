sdled allows to see and change led status for multidisk enclosures.

I'm not sure it will work with every avaible enclosures, but at least it
works with Supermicro chases with SAS enclosures.

    Usage:
    sdled (without options) - display all sd* devices status
    sdled /dev/sd[letter] - display status of requested device
    sdled /dev/sd[letter] faul - set led indicator to 'faulty' 
                          this WILL NOT make device faulty, just set 
                          enclosure led to 'FAULTY' status.
    sdled /dev/sd[letter] locate - set led indicator to 'locate' status
    sdled /dev/sd[letter] off - turn of faulty/locate status

    sdled ALL off
    sdled ALL fault
    sdled ALL locate - turn all devices to that status (note CAPS ALL)

    sample usage : sdled /dev/sde (show status)
                   sdled /dev/sde locate (turn on 'locate' indicator)
